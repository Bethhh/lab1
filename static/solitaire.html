	<h4>Description</h4>

	<!-- p means paragraph -->
	<p>I am working on my own Java app Solitaire in order to apply the knowledge I learned in class to real world. I create Clubs, Hearts, Diamonds and Spades, make them extend superclass Card to inherit all the properties/methods from Card, but they use different pictures and static counters. In Card, I have boolean variables to determine if card is hidden or on the top. The Card and SolitaireController classes implement mouse listeners and have move/drag methods to allow user to interact with cards. In SolitaireController, in order to randomly generate cards, I randomly select a number as priority of the card and add the card to a PriorityQueue each time I create cards in loop. Then I remove the card with highest priority from PriorityQueue one by one, place them on different locations in different piles and connect each pile’s cards as a LinkedList. Then user can drag one or multiple non-hidden cards from a pile to another pile. Whether the dragged card can connect to another pile’s top card depends on the color and number of both non-hidden cards, which is a method in Card.</p>
